As ENZYMES are highly selective catalysts, they remain unchanged at the end of a biochemical reaction.
ENZYMES provide an alternative energy pathway.
ENZYMES only alter the rate of reaction, not the position of equilibrium.
ENZYME COFACTOR
The addition of more substrates won't increase the reaction rate if all active sites are bound, as they are in a rate-limited reaction.
